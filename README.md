Five codes
1. Logistic regression using Iris dataset
trained with a logistic regression model after being transformed into a DataFrame using pandas and sklearn.datasets. The distribution of projected classes is displayed in a bar graph, and the accuracy is printed 

2. Decision Tree using Titanic dataset (loaded using seaborn)
Using the decision tree classifier on the dataset, it drops missing values and maps categoircal variables from the data.

3. KNN using the Digits dataset
Applies the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k=5) to the Digits dataset.It uses train-test split and prints both a preview of the data and the resulting accuracy score.

4.SVM(Support Vector Machine) using the Breast Cancer dataset

5. Random forest using 	Wine dataset
A bar graph of predicted class counts is shown using matplotlib and seaborn.
